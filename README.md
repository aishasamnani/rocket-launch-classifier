# rocket-launch-classifier
This rocket launch classifier predicts whether a rocket launch is likely to be delayed based on specific weather conditions (replicated from [tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/machine-learning-predict-launch-delay-nasa/ 'tutorial')).
All data in the excel file has been taken from the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/ 'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration') and [Wheather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/history 'Wheather Underground').
